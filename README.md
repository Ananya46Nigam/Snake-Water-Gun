# Snake-Water-Gun
A game that never gets old to be fun !!

This is my second project in which I have used basics of C language.

So basically,the rules are pretty simple:
Snake vs. Water: Snake drinks the water hence wins.
Water vs. Gun: The gun will drown in water, hence a point for water
Gun vs. Snake: Gun will kill the snake and win.

In situations where both players choose the same object, the result will be a draw.
